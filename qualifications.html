          <h3>As a dedicated Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, I am driven by a hunger for protecting and helping people through <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20the%20practice%20of,or%20interrupting%20normal%20business%20processes." target="_blank">cybersecurity</a>. My passion for leveraging technology to tackle complex problems and drive innovation motivates me to pursue this field. Maintaining a 3.95 GPA and having received multiple prestigious scholarships, I have built a solid foundation in software engineering, cybersecurity, and data management through rigorous academic coursework and practical experience.

            During my internship as a Maintenance Engineer at <a href="https://www.tenaris.com/en" target="_blank">Tenaris</a>, I successfully upgraded a wireless vibration system and developed an SQL database for managing sensor data. This role significantly enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, providing me with hands-on experience in managing and optimizing critical systems. Prior to this, my apprenticeship at Penwick Realtime Systems Inc. allowed me to further refine my IT and software development skills by tackling various technical challenges and contributing to impactful solutions, deepening my understanding of real-world IT environments.
            
            Additionally, my time at <a href="https://dreamxmedia.com" target="_blank">DreamX Media</a> provided a unique perspective on the convergence of technology and media. Managing high-end audio and video equipment and executing detailed post-production tasks enriched my technical expertise and broadened my understanding of media technologies.
            
            Beyond my technical pursuits, I have demonstrated strong leadership abilities as the President of the Texas A&M Indian Orthodox Campus Ministry, where I coordinate events and promote community engagement, fostering a supportive environment for our members. Serving as a Century Scholar Peer Mentor has enabled me to assist first-year students in navigating their academic and personal challenges.
            
            Proficient in Python, Java, C++, and SQL, and equipped with hands-on experience in various developer tools, I am eager to contribute to impactful projects in software engineering and cybersecurity, where I can continue to grow as a leader, innovative problem-solver, and protector of digital spaces. These ideals, along with God, drive me forward in my career.
