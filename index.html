      <h3>As a dedicated Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, I am deeply motivated by a passion for leveraging technology to tackle complex problems and drive innovation. Maintaining a 3.95 GPA and having received multiple prestigious scholarships, I have established a solid foundation in software engineering, cybersecurity, and data management through rigorous academic coursework and practical experience.
    
    
        During my internship as a Maintenance Engineer at Tenaris, I successfully upgraded a wireless vibration system and developed an SQL database for managing sensor data. This role has significantly enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, providing me with hands-on experience in managing and optimizing critical systems. Prior to this, my apprenticeship at Penwick Realtime Systems Inc. allowed me to further refine my IT and software development skills by tackling various technical challenges and contributing to impactful solutions. This experience was pivotal in deepening my understanding of real-world IT environments and software development practices.
        Additionally, my time at DreamX Media afforded me a unique perspective on the convergence of technology and media. I was responsible for managing high-end audio and video equipment and executing detailed post-production tasks, which enriched my technical expertise and broadened my understanding of media technologies.
        Beyond my technical pursuits, I have demonstrated strong leadership abilities as the President of the Texas A&M Indian Orthodox Campus Ministry. In this role, I coordinate events, promote community engagement, and strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment for our members. Moreover, serving as a Century Scholar Peer Mentor has enabled me to assist first-year students in navigating their academic and personal challenges, fostering their development and success.
        Proficient in Python, Java, C++, and SQL, and equipped with hands-on experience with a variety of developer tools, I am enthusiastic about expanding my technical expertise. My goal is to seek out opportunities where I can contribute to impactful projects in software engineering and cybersecurity, while continuing to grow as a leader and innovative problem-solver.
